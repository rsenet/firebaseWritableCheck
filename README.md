You just have to specify the Firebase Endpoint to know if it is writable or not. If it is, read access will also be checked:

```bash
$ python3 firebaseWritableCheck.py --url https://in-firebase-683e6.firebaseio.com/Logs.json
>> https://in-firebase-683e6.firebaseio.com/Logs.json has been created (write permission is allowed)
>> https://in-firebase-683e6.firebaseio.com/Logs.json is NOT readable (read permission is NOT allowed)
```
